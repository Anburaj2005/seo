                    <h4>What is the SBA Sizing Standard?</h4>

                    <p class="pt-32">The SBA sets the industry standard for small business size. Uses the North American
                        Industry
                        Classification System (NAICS) codes to find various industries. NAICS classifies all economic
                        activity into 20 sectors. NAICS code available here</p>
                    <p class="pt-32">The SBA set up two widely used scale standards. Most manufacturing and mining
                        industries employ 500
                        people and many non-manufacturing industries have an average annual revenue of $7.5 million.</p>


                    <p class="pt-32">500 employees are the most widely used size standard in many common industries such

                    <h4>Businesses Can Grow from Small to Medium Before Losing Benefits</h4>
                    <p class="pt-4">In most industries, these A company that does not exceed the size criteria of A
                        company
                        with 500
                        employees and an average annual income of $7.5 million may not seem small, but the purpose of
                        setting the size bar at these levels is to allow small businesses to reach their advantage
                        before
                        they can thrive in the “medium” scale business is to allow it to grow into a company. The size
                        of
                        small businesses is losing ground. However, the usual size standard of 500 employees/$7.5
                        million
                        does not apply to all industries. The SBA established these size criteria after finding the
                        average
                        size of companies in each industry and the level of competition within each industry.</p>

                        closures. The client
                        decides whether a company with 500 employees from her to 750 employees can participate in this

                    <h4 class="pt-64">Non-manufacturer Rule</h4>
                    <p class="pt-4">Simply put, the Nonmanufacturer Rule allows small businesses to provide products
                        they
                        did not manufacture under the small business closure if SBA offers a waiver.</p>
                    <p class="pt-4">The non-manufacturer rule is an exception to the requirement that the owner of a
                        small
                        business supplying goods to the government under a closing contract pay at least 50% of his cost
                        of
                        manufacturing the goods. The rule allows small business owners to supply products they do not
                        manufacture as long as the products are from another small business.</p>
                    <p class="pt-4">Under statutory authority, the SBA may grant a waiver to this rule and allow a large
                        business to perform more than 50 percent of the cost of performing manufacturing contracts if it
                        finds no small business exists in a particular industry.</p>
                    <h4 class="pt-64">Qualifying as A Non-Manufacturer</h4>

                    <p class="pt-4">In order to qualify as a non-manufacturer, a small business must have less than 500
                        employees, be primarily engaged in the retail or wholesaletrade, normally sell the type of item
                        being supplied, and supply the end item of a small business manufacturer, processor, or producer
                        made in the U.S.</p>
                    <p class="pt-4">In 2011, the SBA updated its regulation to include an additional requirement to be a
                        non-manufacturer:</p>
                    <ul class="ms-3 pt-4 ps-0">
                        <li>The small business must take ownership or possession of the item(s) with its personnel,
                            equipment, or facilities in a manner consistent with industry practice.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="pt-4">This update to the requirements was intended to eliminate confusion at procuring
                        agencies and prevent
                        practices contrary to the intent of the Small Business Act. More specifically, the change seeks
                        to
                        eliminate situations where the SBA has waived the non-manufacturer rule and the prime contractor
                        essentially subcontracts all services, such as warehousing or delivery, to a large business
                        without
                        taking possession of the products. Additionally, the non-manufacturer rule applies only to
                        procurements that have been assigned a manufacturing or supply North American Industry
                        Classification System (NAICS) code—NAICS Sectors 31-33.</p>
                    <h4 class="pt-64">Individual Waivers</h4>
                    <p class="pt-4">Individual waivers are issued when it is justified that no small business
                        manufacturer
                        is able to meet the requirements of a particular RFP. This type of exemption is order-specific
                        and
                        applies only to the main contract.</p>
                    <p class="pt-4">SBA is considering granting individual exemptions after considering small business
                        contractor appointments, including conducting market research. This clause indicates that small
                        and
                        medium-sized manufacturers or processors cannot reasonably be expected to provide products that
                        meet
                        specifications, including useful life, requested by vendors or bidders.</p>

                    <p class="pt-4">Exemptions If the SBA determines that there are no small businesses in a particular
                        industry, it may issue an exception to the nonmanufacturer rule. This exemption allows small
                        businesses, regardless of their size, to offer the products of domestic companies.</p>
                    <p class="pt-4">There are two types of exceptions to the non-manufacturer rule.</p>
                    <p class="pt-4">(1) Individual Contract Exemption </p>

                    <p class="pt-4">Class Waivers are issued only if there are no small business manufacturers in a

                        shall

                    <p class="pt-4">In 2012, paper-based annual returns and certificates were replaced by an automated
                        system developed by the Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE). The Online Representations and
                        Certifications Application (ORCA), an e-government initiative, has replaced the paper-based
                        Representations and Certifications process. These Representations and Certifications
                        (colloquially
                        known as Reps and Certs) contained contractor information that was stored by the government and
                        made
                        available to purchasing officials and government buyers. By completing this information in
                        advance,
                        you avoid having to submit this information each time a contractor bids on the opportunity.
                        Before
                        ORCA was introduced, contractors had to do just that. I had to submit the same information each
                        time
                        I bid on the opportunity.</p>
                    <p class="pt-4">ORCA was incorporated into the government’s System for Award Management (SAM)
                        registry
                        database in 2012. Contractors will complete their contact and attestation once they have
                        completed
                        the SAM registration. The government will then verify this information.</p>

                    <p class="pt-4">The contractor shall include information about the company (including size, company
                        structure, staff, annual turnover, products, services, etc.) in the contact and certification
                        and
                        review this information annually to ensure nothing has changed. verification needed. If
                        contractors
                        don’t update their personnel and certificates when their information changes, the government
                        won’t
                        give them jobs.</p>
                    <p class="pt-4">Contractors are also responsible for updating their personnel and certifications
                        when
                        the government changes requirements. In 2016, the government changed more than 100 of her
                        requirements and contractors had to check their representatives and certificates to ensure their
                        information complied with those changes.</p>
                    <p class="pt-4">In addition to the person and certificate, and an active and valid complete SAM
                        registration, the contractor is required to submit her Marketing Partner Identification Number
                        (MPIN) and her DUNS number to the government.</p>
                    <p class="pt-4">US Federal Contractor Registration (USFCR), a private company, manages customer
                        contacts
                        and certificates. As the government makes changes, the USFCR will review customer information
                        and
                        update it, as necessary. The USFCR also reviews this information annually to coincide with
                        renewal
                        of SAM registrations.</p>
                    <p class="pt-4">Note: US Federal Contractor Registration is an external registrar that charges a fee
                        for
                        registering a full-service System for Award Management (SAM). Their services include a dedicated
                        case manager who physically handles SAM records on behalf of their clients. Although the
                        government
                        offers free registration forms at SAM.gov, SAM does not physically process the forms for its
                        customers. (For more information, visit our website.)</p>
