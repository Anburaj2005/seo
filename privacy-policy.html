                        the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.</p>

                    <h5 class="pt-32">Purpose of Information Collection</h5>

                        card number. By the act of not having your credit card on file, your credit card information is
                        kept secure.</p>

                        to cookies you do not have to log-in repeatedly (from Web page to Web page). A session ID cookie
